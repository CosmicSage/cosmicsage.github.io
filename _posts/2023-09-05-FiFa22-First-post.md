This Is my first post since the SingularityX website where I implemented Google type system which at front looked like a simple blog. Largely My motivation behind it was to feel cool(I had totally wrong ideas about what cool was) and to build employability towards which I have lost interests as I have now realized that I'm set for life anyway.

The reason that website failed was because it takes $10/month to run a Google-shaped thing in cloud fees, and I was too distracted trying to make a tiny amount of money to pursue hobbies, which slowed my monetization strategy for the site and it ran off into unprofitable/unsustainable, and I had to turn it off. So this time, I will first address cash flow first and "cool" (fake) second.

## FiFA22

I poured 807 hours playing this game from June 27th, 2022, to August 27th, 2023. This was my first modern FIFA experience before I would just play FIFA 11 on PlayStation 2 and ever since craved more, which partially explains the ridiculous shameful time spent. I also recorded my plays and uploaded raw to YouTube so I don't completely lose all of my time to nothingness. Of these 800 hours:

1. 300 hours for single player games
2. 300 hours of Multiplayer
3. 150 hours of making cards other decorative stuff for Multiplayer bs
4. 50 hours of standby waiting for matchmaking (60% of total time came after this game was outdated).

I played this game like an addict. For years, I would try to convince others to play in real life, like in-game stores, without much success. So when I bought it on 87% off during the Champions League final week of 2022, I was thrilled.

My initial experience was bad. I didn't enjoy sitting by myself and playing; I wasn't used to it. So, I didn't play much before I stumbled into Ultimate Team, a limbic system hack.

So my realization to self would be the fact that I started to play the game to simulate real life football myself like Im in a movie, and I pretty much did exactly that. There's no scenario  which I didn't enact (all involving  **Frank Lampard**):

1. Last-minute winners
2. Last-minute winners where I blast the ball in from 35 yards
3. Goal-line tap-ins
4. Ridiculous bend free-kick goals
5. 80% possession (keep) see out 3-2 win in the last 30 minutes
etc.
** Very Important  All this happened against 5-2-1-2 Dropback 98 squads at 20 depth defense, constant pressure hustlers, whereas I just had a 91 Icon moments Frank Lampard**

I essentially raw dogged these people for the longest time with 20 games win streak with barely a squad and reached top 3% of players.

# The Fall

At some point, one realizes this, and if you agree, reach out: Instead of me playing the game, the game begins to play me.

After completing my initial objective, which I didn't really notice, I got super stuck in my ego. And this is where the latter half of the 800 hours came from. At some point, I was just playing for the win like a rat with a one-dimensional brain. It is very hard to explain this painful state of limbic system where the neurons are all torn apart, burnt, incapacitated, drained reward circuit, like a rat constantly jam X X X without any creativity whatsoever on the bloody unresponsive Sony DualSense. I entered crazy losing streaks, and my ego was badly damaged.

All this left me with only one option: hard quit limbic hack Ultimate team merry go ride. And this brings to the final realization

# The realization
After all this I learnt the following:
1. Video games(Multiplayer) are whores: Yea you are dicking it deep right now but sooner or later it's economic ........
2. Im not a pro player: I entered this just as an art to expeience I did and now get the fuck out.
3. So the puninshment largely remains (ego damage) and the lesson was hard to stick

Maybe I'll elaborate further later
